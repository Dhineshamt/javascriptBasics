1. Difference between let and var:
    i.   The 'let' keyword is the latest one where 'var' is the old keyword to declare a variable in javascript. 
    ii.  These two has a significant difference interms block scope.
    iii. The scope of the variable declared using 'let' keyword ends within the block where it is declared.
        See below implementation for example:         
            let i = 1;
            if( i == 1) {
                let number = 10;
            }
            console.log(number);

        The scope of variable 'number' ends within if block. Hence, trying to print it in console outside if block 
        will through error. Whereas the scope of variable declared using 'var' keyword does not end within the scope.

        See below implementation for example:
            let i = 1;
            if( i == 1) {
                let name = 'Dhinesh';
            }
            console.log(name);
        The scope of variable 'name' does not end within if block but, extends outside if as well. Hence, trying to 
        print name outside if block won't through an error and, will successfully prints the name.

    iv. The same scope logic applies to other block of codes such as function, for, for each loop as well.

    v. The accessibility of variables declared using 'var' keyword makes it ambiguous. Hence, 'let' is advised to
        use in programs.

2. What is Rest parameters?
    1. This is simplest way to accept array of variables in a function.
        For example:
            function printNumbers(...numbers) {
                number.forEach(number => console.log(number));
            }
            printNumbers(1,2,3,4);
    2. The same concept in java called 'varargs'.
    3. See example for sending other other parameter with rest parameter.
            function printNumbers(count, ...numbers) {
                number.forEach(number => console.log(number));
            }
            printNumbers('four', 1,2,3,4);
